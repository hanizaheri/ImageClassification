# ImageClassification
This is the neural networks project for the Computational Intelligence coures. We used a fully connected neural network described in the [description file](https://github.com/hanizaheri/ImageClassification/blob/main/CI_project1.pdf)) to classify four classes of [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.
